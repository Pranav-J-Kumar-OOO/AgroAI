Based on the location provided in Tirupparangunram with the current weather and soil data, here are crop suggestions for you:

1. Rice: Rice is a staple crop that thrives in clay soil. It requires high water content, making it suitable given the current temperature and soil type in Tirupparangunram.

2. Sugarcane: Sugarcane grows well in warm temperatures and is a profitable crop for clay soil. It can utilize the nutrients present in the soil effectively.

3. Turmeric: Turmeric is well-suited for clay soil and the current weather conditions. It requires moderate water and is a valuable cash crop.

4. Groundnuts: Groundnuts are leguminous crops that can fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other crops in rotation. They grow well in clay soil and warm temperatures.

For nutrition and soil health, consider the following suggestions:

1. Nitrogen: Given the nitrogen levels in the soil, supplement with organic matter like compost or manure to improve soil fertility for crop growth.

2. Phosphorus and Potassium: Conduct a soil test to determine the levels of phosphorus and potassium in the soil. If deficient, consider adding fertilizers rich in these nutrients.

3. Micronutrients: Look into micronutrient deficiencies and use appropriate fertilizers to ensure optimal crop growth and yield.

For crop rotation in the upcoming seasons, here is a suggested pattern:

1. Season 1 - Rice: Start with rice cultivation as it is well-suited for the current conditions and soil type.

2. Season 2 - Sugarcane: Follow up with sugarcane to utilize the nutrients leftover from rice cultivation and benefit from the warm climate.

3. Season 3 - Groundnuts: Introduce groundnuts as they can fix nitrogen in the soil, preparing it for subsequent crops.

4. Season 4 - Turmeric: Finish the rotation with turmeric, which thrives in clay soil and complements the earlier crops in terms of nutrient requirements.       

For mixed cropping, consider the following combinations:

1. Rice and Turmeric: Interplanting rice and turmeric can optimize land use and provide diversification in crops.

2. Groundnuts and Sugarcane: Growing groundnuts alongside sugarcane can help in nitrogen fixation and improve soil health.

3. Sugarcane and Turmeric: Combining sugarcane and turmeric can offer both economic benefits and ensure soil nutrient balance.

Regarding harvest times for the suggested crops:

1. Rice: Harvest typically occurs 5-6 months after planting, around the end of the monsoon season.

2. Sugarcane: Sugarcane is usually ready for harvest after 10-12 months of growth, depending on the variety.

3. Turmeric: Turmeric is ready for harvest after 7-9 months when the leaves start turning yellow.

4. Groundnuts: Groundnuts are harvested after 3-5 months when the plant starts to dry up, indicating the pods are ready for collection.

By following these crop suggestions, nutrition recommendations, crop rotation patterns, and mixed cropping options, you can optimize your farming practices in Tirupparangunram for a successful harvest.
